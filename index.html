            Anushka Sharma (pronounced [əˈnʊʃka ˈʃərma]; born 1 May 1988) is an
            Indian actress who works in Hindi films. Her awards include a
            Filmfare Award. She has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 in
            the 2010s and was featured by Forbes Asia in their 30 Under 30 list
            of 2018.[1]

            Born in Ayodhya and raised in Bangalore, Sharma had her first
            modelling assignment for the fashion designer Wendell Rodricks in
            2007 and later moved to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career as a
            model. She made her acting debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the
            top-grossing romantic film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) and rose to
            prominence with starring roles in Yash Raj Films' romances Band
            Baaja Baaraat (2010) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012); winning the
            Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for the latter. Sharma
            went on to earn praise for playing strong-willed women in the crime
            thriller NH10 (2015), and the dramas Dil Dhadakne Do (2015), Ae Dil
            Hai Mushkil (2016), and Sui Dhaaga (2018). Her highest-grossing
            releases came with the sports drama Sultan (2016), and Rajkumar
            Hirani's films PK (2014) and Sanju (2018). The poorly received Zero
            (2018) was followed by a hiatus from acting.

            Sharma was the co-founder of the production company Clean Slate
            Filmz, under which she produced several films and web series,
            including NH10 and Paatal Lok (2020). She is the ambassador for
            brands and products, has designed her own line of clothing for
            women, named Nush, and supports various charities and causes,
            including gender equality and animal rights. Sharma is married to
            the cricketer Virat Kohli, with whom she has two children.
